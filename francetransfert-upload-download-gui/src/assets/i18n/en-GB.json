  "Question1_Texte": "<span>France Transfert is a service created by the government to help its users (citizens, professionals, companies, associations, etc.), partners and service provides exchange large files and folders that cannot be sent by email with government personnel.It was designed and is operated by the Ministry of Culture, and made available to all ministries by the Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM).</span><br><span>The service is hosted in France by Outscale. The data is stored on French servers until it is downloaded by the recipient.</span> ",
  "Question2_Texte": "<span>France Transfert is reserved for exchanging large files between government services and their users. It is not possible to exchange files between users.</span>",
  "Question3_Texte1": "France Transfert can be used in two different ways:",
  "Question3_Liste": "<li> <span>Email delivery, accessible to both officials and users. This feature allows senders (officials or users) to send large files to one or more known recipients. However, if the sender is a user, recipients must be officials. It is not possible to exchange files between users. </span></li><li> <span>The “link” feature is only available to officials. It generates a public link to the files. The sender then sends the link and password to the appropriate recipients. The difference is that recipients can then share the link without the sender being able to control when it is downloaded.</span> </li>",
  "Question3_Texte2": "<span>N.B. If you want to send a package to a functional email address (used by a group), we do not recommend using the “email delivery” option. A package can only be downloaded five times per recipient. </span>",
  "Question4_Texte": "Yes. France Transfert was designed as a Progressive Web App and can therefore be installed as an application (the web browser will invite you to do so). ",
  "Question5_Texte": "<span>People could use France Transfert for personal use by “borrowing” the email address of an official or user. To avoid this, the sender will receive an email containing a confirmation code. When you add the files to transfer, you will have to enter the confirmation code, which is valid 20 minutes. </span> <br><span>If you have logged in and decide to send another package less than 30 min after the previous one, you will not be asked for a new confirmation code.</span>",
  "Question6_Texte1": "You can decide to log in to France Transfert before or when sending a package by clicking on “Stay connected”. ",
  "Question6_Liste": "<li><span>Logging in confirms that you are the owner of the email address indicated as the sender of the package: a confirmation code is sent by email and you have 20 minutes to enter it. </span></li> <li> <span> Once you are logged in, you no longer need to enter your email address again to send another package. </span> </li> <li> <span>  You will remain logged in for 30 min and can send another package during that period. If you do not create another package before the end of that period, you will have to log in again.</span></li>",
  "Question6_Texte2": "<span>Logging in does not require you to create a user account. It is only a means of verifying your email address and saving you the effort of proceeding with verification for every package.  </span> <span>If you are already logged in and want to send using a different email address, simply click on “Log out”. You can then go through the connection process, either when sending your next package, or after clicking on “Log in”.</span><br> <span>However, if you open France Transfert in a new tab or refresh the page, the login information is erased. </span><br> <span>You can also decide not to log in, in which case you will need to enter a confirmation code each time you send a package. </span>",
  "Question7_Texte": "<span>Once files are submitted to France Transfert, they are scanned for viruses and may be deleted if necessary. </span><br> <span>If the scan goes well, a confirmation email is sent to the sender, along with the password to download the package. Recipients receive an email with a download link and a password in a separate email. </span><br> <span>If the virus scan is long (large packages) then the confirmation email may take a long time to arrive. The sender receives an email either to inform them of an error (such as a security issue) or to confirm delivery (in which case recipients also receive an email with download instructions).</span>",
  "Question8_Texte": "<span>When the package is sent, a confirmation email with details of the package files is sent to the sender, as is the password to download the package.</span><br> <span>Recipients receive an email with a download link and a password in a separate email.</span> <br><span>If the password is not accepted, check that no trailing space was copied with it (use the eye pictogram to display the password).</span>",
  "Question9_Texte1": "Did you make a mistake entering recipients? Several options are available from the package administration page (administration link received in the delivery confirmation email), depending on your needs:",
  "Question9_Liste": "<li> Delete the package: the package is completely deleted, and no recipients can download it anymore.</li><li>Delete one or more recipients: the download links of selected recipients are revoked and can no longer be used to download files.</li><li>Add a recipient: you can manually add one or more package recipients. Like the original recipients, they will receive an email with a download link and a password in a separate email. </li>",
  "Question9_Texte2": "If you delete a package or a recipient, do inform affected recipients so that they do not try in vain to download the package.",
  "Question10_Texte": "<span>Each recipient has their own link to download the package. With this link, each recipient can download the package 5 times. </span><br><span>This allows recipients to download the files again if they need to (in case of deletion from their computer, for example). </span><br><span>If a recipient exceeds the 5-download limit, a new package will have to be sent. This may also be necessary if the recipient has “locked” their link by entering the wrong download password more than 5 times. </span>",
  "Question11_Texte": "<span>Files are deleted after the package’s validity period (default 30 days) has expired. Packages are not deleted automatically once all recipients have downloaded them, as recipients may need to download them again.</span>",
  "Question12_Texte": "<span>The files are downloaded via your browser. Depending on its configuration, they may go directly to the “Downloads” folder, or you may be asked to decide where to save them.</span>",
  "Question13_Texte": "<span>France Transfert allows you to send up to 20 GB of files and folders per package, so long as no file exceeds 2 GB.</span>",
  "Question14_Texte": "<span>All common file extensions are accepted on France Transfert except, for security reasons, certain executable files and computer scripts that could contain viruses.</span><br> <span>List of prohibited file extensions: </span><br> <span>“ade, a3x, adp, app, appinstaller, applescript, application, appref-ms, appx, appxbundle, asp, aspx, asx, bas, bat, cer, chm, cmd, cnt, com, cpl, crt, csh, daa, der, diagcab, dll, dmg, exe, fxp, gadget, grp, hlp, hpj, hta, htc, img, inf, ins, iso, isp, its, jar, jnlp, js, jse, ksh, lnk, mad, maf, mag, mam, maq, mar, mas, mat, mau, mav, maw, mcf, mda, mdb, mde, mdt, mdw, mdz, msc, msh, msh1, msh1xml, msh2, msh2xml, mshxml, msi, msp, mst, msu, ocx, ops, osd, pcd, pif, pl, plg, ppa, ppam, ppkg, prf, prg, printerexport, ps1, ps1xml, ps2, ps2xml, psc1, psc2, psd1, psdm1, pst, py, pyc, pyo, pyw, pyz, pyzw, reg, scf, scpt, scr, sct, service, settingcontent-ms, shb, shs, so, theme, timer, tmp, url, vb, vbe, vbp, vbs, vhd, vhdx, vsmacros, vsw, webpnp, website, wim, ws, wsc, wsf, wsh, xbap, xlam, xll, xnk”.</span><br> <span>When you send a file, do make sure your recipient can open it.</span>",
  "Question15_Texte": "<span>To send a package to several recipients at once, you can upload a CSV file containing their addresses (using the semicolon (;) separator). To do this, click on the pictogram to the right of the “Recipients” field. </span><br> <span>You can generate a CSV file from your recipients by clicking on the pictogram to the right of the address list. You can store and use it to automatically complete the recipient list for your next package. </span>",
  "Question16_Texte": "<span>The questionnaire is anonymous and used for statistical and improvement purposes only. </span><br><span>If you complete the questionnaire, the rating you leave is recorded for statistical purposes only. You can leave comments to tell us what you think about the service.</span><br><span>The product team will review the comments but cannot commit to responding individually or implementing any suggestions.</span>",
  "Question17_Texte": "<span>For officials, there is a “France Transfert” room in Tchap to keep track of developments and communicate with other members. You can sign up to it. </span><br> <span>You can also write to France Transfert’s support team via the “Contact” form (at the bottom of the page or in the menu on the mobile version). </span>",
